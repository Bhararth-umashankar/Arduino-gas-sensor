Gas leakage is a common problem in households worldwide.
It is an imminent danger and can cause severe damage to houses and can ruin lives, as it is not easily detectable.
We live in an age where such conundrums should be avoided at all costs.
Our aim is to use smart circuits and internet of things to help make households safer and make gas leaks more detectable.
