# Lpg Detector Arduino  
Gas leakage is a common problem in households worldwide.
It is an imminent danger and can cause severe damage to houses and can ruin lives, as it is not easily detectable.
We live in an age where such conundrums should be avoided at all costs.
Our aim is to use smart circuits and internet of things to help make households safer and make gas leaks more detectable.
What is the outcome of this project??
The main outcome of this project is to detect the leakage of LPG. If the the gas is leaking and the house if the intensity of the gas starts to increase and exceeds a certain value then the windows in the house gets opened automatically and an email is sent to the owner of the house saying ' Gas is leaking in your house'.
